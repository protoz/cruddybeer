# Cruddy Beer is a CRUD exercise using Flask.

From this, a user will be able to do the following:

- add/remove a brewery
- add/remove a beer to a chosen brewery

## Requirements
pip install flask

pip install mongoengine


## What you can currently do:

### Add a Brewery and associate a beer using the manage.py
> python manage.py shell
>
> from cruddybeer.models import Beer, Brewery
> brewery = Brewery(
> name = "Brewery Name",
> slug = "brewery-name",
> description = "Brewery Description"
> )
> brewery.save()
>
> beer = Beer(
> name="Beer Name",
> description="Beer Description"
> )
> brewery.beers.append(beer)
> brewery.save()*

You will now have a collection in the test database of MongoDB called brewery.


## Starting Cruddybeer
Start the flask application with python run.py

## Future To-Do
- Add proper testing
- Add a UI to add breweries and beer
